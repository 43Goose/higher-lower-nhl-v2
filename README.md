# Higher or Lower NHL

A game inspired by the popular Higher Lower game by Gabritrav01; however, instead of using monthly google searches this game uses NHL player stats taken from the free NHL API.


## Beta

There are still some kinks to be worked out; most of which come from the grabbing of player stats from the API so if you notice any bugs feel free to make a post on here.
